# Nematode volume calculations
Some quick calculations estimating the total soil nematode volume and comparing it to the total human volume.

## Results
The volume of nematodes represents `101.4%` of human volume.

In total, there are `1337.603` Billion cans of worms on the planet.

### Some assumptions:
- Human bodyweight, on average: `50 kg`
- Number of humans: `7.4 B`
- Body density humans: `985 kg/m3`
- Volume of Campbell's soup: `0.284 L`

### Nematode community composition:
- Percentage of adult nematodes: `30%`
- percentage of juveniles: `70%`
