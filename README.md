# Nematode volume calculations
Some quick calculations estimating the total soil nematode volume and comparing it to the total human volume.

## Some assumptions:
- Human bodyweight, on average: `50 kg`
- Number of humans: `7.4 B`
- Body density humans: `985 kg/m3`

## Nematode community composition:
- Percentage of adult nematodes: `30%`
- percentage of juveniles: `70%`
